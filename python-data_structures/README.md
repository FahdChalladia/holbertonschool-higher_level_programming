# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on Python data structures, particularly working with lists and tuples. The project introduces key sequence operations, indexing, mutation, and the distinctions between mutable and immutable types.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file implements a specific task demonstrating different aspects of data structure handling in Python.

### Files

- `0-print_list_integer.py`  
  Prints all integers of a list using `str.format()` (one per line).

- `1-element_at.py`  
  Retrieves an element from a list safely using an index.

- `2-replace_in_list.py`  
  Replaces an element in a list at a specific position.

- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`  
  Prints all integers of a list in reverse order using `str.format()`.

- `4-new_in_list.py`  
  Replaces an element in a list without modifying the original list.

- `5-no_c.py`  
  Returns a string with all 'c' and 'C' characters removed.

- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`  
  Prints a matrix of integers using nested loops and `str.format()`.

- `7-add_tuple.py`  
  Adds two tuples and returns a tuple with the sum of their first and second elements.

- `8-multiple_returns.py`  
  Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

- `9-max_integer.py`  
  Finds and returns the biggest integer in a list.

- `10-divisible_by_2.py`  
  Returns a list of booleans representing whether each integer in the original list is divisible by 2.

- `11-delete_at.py`  
  Deletes an item at a specific position in a list.

- `12-switch.py`  
  Switches the values of two variables using tuple unpacking.
