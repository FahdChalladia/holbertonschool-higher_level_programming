# Python - Test-driven development

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on writing documentation and tests first (TDD) before implementing Python functions, ensuring code correctness through doctests and unittests.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file implements a specific function or module with full documentation and associated test cases written before implementation.

### Files

- `0-add_integer.py`  
  Implements a function that adds two integers or floats (casted to int), raising `TypeError` if arguments are invalid.

- `2-matrix_divided.py`  
  Implements a function that divides all elements of a matrix by a divisor with validation and rounding.

- `3-say_my_name.py`  
  Implements a function that prints “My name is <first_name> <last_name>” with input type checking.

- `4-print_square.py`  
  Implements a function that prints a square made of `#` characters, validating size input.

- `5-text_indentation.py`  
  Implements a function that prints text with two newlines after `.`, `?`, and `:`, validating input type.

- `6-max_integer.py`  
  Implements a function that returns the max integer in a list, or None if empty, with unittests provided.
