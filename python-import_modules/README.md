# Python - Import & Modules

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on learning how to import functions, use modules, and work with command-line arguments in Python.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file implements a specific task related to Python imports, modules, and basic scripting operations.
