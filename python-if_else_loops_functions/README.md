# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on understanding basic control flow tools in Python, such as `if`, `else`, loops, and functions. The project teaches how to manipulate and format strings, numbers, and implement simple functions.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file implements a specific task related to conditional statements, loops, and functions.

### Files

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`  
  Prints whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive, negative, or zero.

- `1-last_digit.py`  
  Prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`, and categorizes it based on its value.

- `2-print_alphabet.py`  
  Prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase.

- `3-print_alphabt.py`  
  Prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'e' and 'q'.

- `4-print_hexa.py`  
  Prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal formats.

- `5-print_comb2.py`  
  Prints all numbers from 00 to 99, separated by commas and spaces.

- `6-print_comb3.py`  
  Prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order.

- `7-islower.py`  
  Checks if a character is in lowercase and returns `True` or `False`.

- `8-uppercase.py`  
  Prints a string in uppercase.

- `9-print_last_digit.py`  
  Prints the last digit of a number.

- `10-add.py`  
  Adds two integers and returns the result.

- `11-pow.py`  
  Computes the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`.

- `12-fizzbuzz.py`  
  Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
