# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on working with more advanced data structures in Python such as sets and dictionaries, along with lambda functions and functional programming tools like map, reduce, and filter.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file implements a specific task related to Python sets, dictionaries, and functional programming concepts.

### Files

- `0-square_matrix_simple.py`  
  Implements a function that computes the square of all integers in a matrix without modifying the original matrix.

- `1-search_replace.py`  
  Implements a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

- `2-uniq_add.py`  
  Implements a function that adds all unique integers in a list (each integer counted only once).

- `3-common_elements.py`  
  Implements a function that returns a set of common elements between two sets.

- `4-only_diff_elements.py`  
  Implements a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one of two sets.

- `5-number_keys.py`  
  Implements a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

- `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`  
  Implements a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys (alphabetically).

- `7-update_dictionary.py`  
  Implements a function that replaces or adds key/value pairs in a dictionary.

- `8-simple_delete.py`  
  Implements a function that deletes a key in a dictionary if it exists.

- `9-multiply_by_2.py`  
  Implements a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

- `10-best_score.py`  
  Implements a function that returns the key with the biggest integer value in a dictionary.

- `11-multiply_list_map.py`  
  Implements a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops (using `map`).

- `12-roman_to_int.py`  
  Implements a function that converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.
